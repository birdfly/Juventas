	title = {Electrochemical analyte},
	url = {http://www.google.ch/patents/US6134461},
	abstract = {An electrochemical analyte sensor formed using conductive traces on a substrate can be used for determining and/or monitoring a level of analyte in in vitro or in vivo analyte-containing fluids. For example, an implantable sensor may be used for the continuous or automatic monitoring of a level of an analyte, such as glucose, lactate, or oxygen, in a patient. The electrochemical analyte sensor includes a substrate and conductive material disposed on the substrate, the conductive material forming a working electrode. In some sensors, the conductive material is disposed in recessed channels formed in a surface of the sensor. An electron transfer agent and/or catalyst may be provided to facilitate the electrolysis of the analyte or of a second compound whose level depends on the level of the analyte. A potential is formed between the working electrode and a reference electrode or counter/reference electrode and the resulting current is a function of the concentration of the analyte in the body fluid.},

	abstract = {Background
A novel flash glucose monitoring system (FGMS) (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott, UK) was recently developed for humans. It continuously measures the interstitial glucose (IG) concentrations for 14 days.

Objectives
To assess the clinical and analytical accuracy of the FGMS in diabetic dogs.

Animals
Ten client‐owned diabetic dogs on insulin treatment.

Methods
Prospective and observational study. The FGMS was placed on the neck for up to 14 days. During the 1st–2nd, 6–7th, and 13–14th days from application, the IG measurements were compared with the plasma (EDTA) glucose (PG) concentrations analyzed by a reference hexokinase based method.

Results
The application and the use of the FGMS were apparently painless, easy, and well tolerated by all dogs. Mild erythema at the site of the application was found in 5/10 dogs at the end of the wearing period. A good correlation between IG and PG concentrations (rho = 0.94; P {\textless} .001) was found. The FGMS was 93, 99, and 99\% accurate at low, normal, and high blood glucose concentrations. Mean ± standard deviation difference from the reference method was 2.3 ± 46.8 mg/dL.

Conclusion and clinical importance
The FGMS is easy to use and is accurate for IG glucose measurement in diabetic dogs.},
