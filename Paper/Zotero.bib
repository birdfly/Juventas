	doi = {10.1177/1932296813511747},
	abstract = {Background:
Continuous glucose monitoring using subcutaneously inserted sensors currently requires blood glucose tests for sensor calibration. Alternatively, sensors precalibrated during the manufacturing process may eliminate the need for fingerstick calibrations. In this study we evaluated the feasibility of sensor factory calibration in subjects with diabetes.

Methods:
A total of 33 subjects with diabetes were asked to wear 4 sensors in parallel, 2 on the arm and 2 on the abdomen. Sensors from a lot with low in vitro sensitivity coefficient of variation were used in the study. Based on frequent capillary blood glucose measurements, the average glucose sensitivity of each sensor was determined over a 5-day wear time. The in vivo sensitivities were analyzed for inter- and intrasubject variation. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) calculation and consensus error grid analysis (EGA) were performed using a single calibration factor for all sensors, to simulate factory calibration and compared against conventional finger-stick calibration.

Results:
The sensitivity coefficient of variation between sensors increased from 2.9\% in vitro to 6.0\% in vivo. No difference in sensor response between subjects (P = .069) as well as between insertion sites (arm and abdomen) was detected (P = .104). Applying one calibration factor to all sensors in the study resulted in an MARD of 13.4\%, and 83.5\% of the values fell in consensus EGA zone A. Multiple fingerstick calibration resulted in an MARD of 12.7\% and 84.1\% in zone A.

Conclusions:
Feasibility of factory calibration was demonstrated in subjects with diabetes using sensors based on “wired enzyme” technology, resulting in accuracy metrics similar to sensors calibrated with capillary blood glucose.},

	abstract = {Although the scientific literature contains numerous reports of the statistical accuracy of systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), most of these studies determine accuracy in ways that may not be clinically useful. We have developed an error grid analysis (EGA), which describes the clinical accuracy of SMBG systems over the entire range of blood glucose values, taking into account 1) the absolute value of the system-generated glucose value, 2) the absolute value of the reference blood glucose value, 3) the relative difference between these two values, and 4) the clinical significance of this difference. The EGA of accuracy of five different reflectance meters (Eyetone, Dextrometer, Glucometer I, Glucometer II, Memory Glucometer II), a visually interpretable glucose reagent strip (Glucostix), and filter-paper spot glucose determinations is presented. In addition, reanalyses of a laboratory comparison of three reflectance meters (Accucheck II, Glucometer II, Glucoscan 9000) and of two previously published studies comparing the accuracy of five different reflectance meters with EGA is described. EGA provides the practitioner and the researcher with a clinically meaningful method for evaluating the accuracy of blood glucose values generated with various monitoring systems and for analyzing the clinical implications of previously published data.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endianness&oldid=812521270},
	abstract = {Endianness refers to the sequential order in which bytes are arranged into larger numerical values when stored in memory or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in computer science because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the big end (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit).
In big-endian format, whenever addressing memory or sending/storing words bytewise, the most significant byte — the byte containing the most significant bit — is stored first (has the lowest address) or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with the least significant byte — the one containing the least significant bit — stored last (having the highest address) or sent last.
Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (lowest address) and the most significant byte last (highest address). Most computer systems prefer a single format for all its data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format.
The order of bits within a byte or word can also have endianness (as discussed later); however, a byte is typically handled as a single numerical value or character symbol and so bit sequence order is obviated.
Both big and little forms of endianness are widely used in digital electronics. The choice of endianness for a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness and many other design attributes to maintain backward compatibility. As examples, the IBM z/Architecture mainframes and the Motorola 68000 series use big-endian while the Intel x86 processors use little-endian. The designers of System/360, the ancestor of z/Architecture, chose its endianness in the 1960s; the designers of the Motorola 68000 and the Intel 8086, the first members of the 68000 and x86 families, chose their endianness in the 1970s.
Big-endian is the most common format in data networking; fields in the protocols of the Internet protocol suite, such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP, are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as network byte order. Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors, in part due to significant influence on microprocessor designs by Intel Corporation. Mixed forms also exist, for instance the ordering of bytes in a 16-bit word may differ from the ordering of 16-bit words within a 32-bit word. Such cases are sometimes referred to as mixed-endian or middle-endian. There are also some bi-endian processors that operate in either little-endian or big-endian mode.

Such cards can normally be read out by a reader without being powered themselves, as the reader will supply the necessary power to the card over the air (wireless).
ISO/IEC 15693 systems operate at the 13.56 MHz frequency, and offer maximum read distance of 1–1.5 meters. As the vicinity cards have to operate at a greater distance, the necessary magnetic field is less (0.15 to 5 A/m) than that for a proximity card (1.5 to 7.5 A/m).},

NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems. This is sometimes referred to as NFC/CTLS (Contactless) or CTLS NFC. NFC is used for social networking, for sharing contacts, photos, videos or files. NFC-enabled devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards. NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more capable wireless connections.},

	abstract = {Background
A novel flash glucose monitoring system (FGMS) (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott, UK) was recently developed for humans. It continuously measures the interstitial glucose (IG) concentrations for 14 days.

Objectives
To assess the clinical and analytical accuracy of the FGMS in diabetic dogs.

Animals
Ten client‐owned diabetic dogs on insulin treatment.

Methods
Prospective and observational study. The FGMS was placed on the neck for up to 14 days. During the 1st–2nd, 6–7th, and 13–14th days from application, the IG measurements were compared with the plasma (EDTA) glucose (PG) concentrations analyzed by a reference hexokinase based method.

Results
The application and the use of the FGMS were apparently painless, easy, and well tolerated by all dogs. Mild erythema at the site of the application was found in 5/10 dogs at the end of the wearing period. A good correlation between IG and PG concentrations (rho = 0.94; P {\textless} .001) was found. The FGMS was 93, 99, and 99\% accurate at low, normal, and high blood glucose concentrations. Mean ± standard deviation difference from the reference method was 2.3 ± 46.8 mg/dL.

Conclusion and clinical importance
The FGMS is easy to use and is accurate for IG glucose measurement in diabetic dogs.},
